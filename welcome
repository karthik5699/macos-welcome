    morning="Life loves me!
    All is well in my world. Everything is working out for my highest good. Out of this situation only good will come. I am safe!
    It’s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.
    The point of power is always in the present moment.
    Every thought we think is creating our future.
    I am in the process of positive change.
    I am comfortable looking in the mirror, saying, 'I love you, I really love you.'
    It is safe to look within.
    I forgive myself and set myself free.
    As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.
    I now go beyond other people’s fears and limitations.
    I am Divinely guided and protected at all times.
    I trust the process of life.
    I am deeply fulfilled by all that I do.
    We are all family, and the planet is our home.
    As I forgive myself, it becomes easier to forgive others.
    I am willing to let go.
    Deep at the center of my being is an infinite well of love.
    I prosper wherever I turn."

    afternoon="I welcome miracles into my life.
    Whatever I need to know is revealed to me at exactly the right time.
    I am loved, and I am at peace.
    My happy thoughts help create my healthy body.
    Life supports me in every possible way.
    My day begins and ends with gratitude.
    I listen with love to my body’s messages.
    The past is over.
    Only good can come to me.
    I am beautiful, and everybody loves me.
    Everyone I encounter today has my best interests at heart.
    I always work with and for wonderful people. I love my job.
    Filling my mind with pleasant thoughts is the quickest road to health.
    I am healthy, whole, and complete.
    I devote a portion of my time to helping others. It is good for my own health.
    I am greeted by love wherever I go.
    Wellness is the natural state of my body. I am in perfect health.
    I am pain free and totally in sync with life.
    I am very thankful for all the love in my life. I find it everywhere."
